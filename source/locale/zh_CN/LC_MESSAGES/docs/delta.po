"Deltas are a simple, yet expressive format that can be used to describe "
"Quill’s contents and changes. The format is a strict subset of JSON, is "
"human readable, and easily parsible by machines. Deltas can describe any "
"Quill document, includes all text and formatting information, without the"
" ambiguity and complexity of HTML."

"Don’t be confused by its name Delta—Deltas represents both documents and "
"changes to documents. If you think of Deltas as the instructions from "
"going from one document to another, the way Deltas represent a document "
"is by expressing the instructions starting from an empty document."

"Deltas are implemented as a separate `standalone library "
"<https://github.com/quilljs/delta/>`__, allowing its use outside of "
"Quill. It is suitable for `Operational Transform "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation>`__ and can be "
"used in realtime, Google Docs like applications. For a more in depth "
"explanation behind Deltas, see `Designing the Delta Format </guides"
"/designing-the-delta-format/>`__."

"**Note:** It is not recommended to construct Deltas by hand—rather use "
"the chainable ```insert()`` <https://github.com/quilljs/delta#insert>`__,"
" ```delete()`` <https://github.com/quilljs/delta#delete>`__, and "
"```retain()`` <https://github.com/quilljs/delta#retain>`__ methods to "
"create new Deltas. You can use ```import()`` </docs/api/#import>`__ to "
"access Delta from Quill."

"The Delta format is almost entirely self-explanatory—the example below "

"As its name would imply, describing content is actually a special case "
"for Deltas. The above example is more specifically instructions to insert"
" a bolded string “Gandalf”, an unformatted string \" the “, followed by "
"the string”Grey\" colored #cccccc. When Deltas are used to describe "
"content, it can be thought of as the content that would be created if the"
" Delta was applied to an empty document."

"Since Deltas are a data format, there is no inherent meaning to the "
"values of ``attribute`` keypairs. For example, there is nothing in the "
"Delta format that dictates color value must be in hex—this is a choice "
"that Quill makes, and can be modified if desired with `Parchment "
"<https://github.com/quilljs/parchment/>`__."

"For non-text content such as images or formulas, the insert key can be an"

"its type. This is the ``blotName`` if you are building custom content "
"with `Parchment <https://github.com/quilljs/parchment/>`__. Like text, "
"embeds can still have an ``attributes`` key to describe formatting to be "
"applied to the embed. All embeds have a length of one."
