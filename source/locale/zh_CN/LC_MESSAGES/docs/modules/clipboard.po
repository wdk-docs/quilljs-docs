"The Clipboard handles copy, cut and paste between Quill and external "
"applications. A set of defaults exist to provide sane interpretation of "
"pasted content, with the ability for further customization through "

"The Clipboard interprets pasted HTML by traversing the corresponding DOM "
"tree in `post-order <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Post-"
"order>`__, building up a `Delta </docs/delta/>`__ representation of all "
"subtrees. At each descendant node, matcher functions are called with the "
"DOM Node and Delta interpretation so far, allowing the matcher to return "
"a modified Delta interpretation."
