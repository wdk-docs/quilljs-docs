"Content creation has been at the core to the web since its beginning. The"
" ``<textarea>`` provides a native and essential solution to almost any "
"web application. But at some point you may need to add formatting to text"
" input. This is where rich text editors come in. There are many solutions"
" to choose from, but Quill brings a few modern ideas to consider."

"Rich text editors are built to help people write text. Yet surprisingly, "
"most rich text editors have no idea what text the user composed. These "
"editors see their content through the same lens a web developer does: the"
" DOM. This presents an impedance mismatch since the DOM is made up of "
"Nodes organized in an unbalanced tree, whereas text is made up of lines, "
"words and characters."
msgstr "富文本编辑器都内置帮人写的文字. 然而奇怪的是,最丰富的文本编辑器不知道用户什么组成的文本. 这些编辑识破同一透镜Web开发人员做他们的内容：DOM中. 这带来的阻抗不匹配,因为DOM是由在一个不平衡的树组织的节点中,而文字是由行,词和字符. "

"There is no DOM API where characters is the unit of measure. With this "
"limitation, most rich text editors cannot answer simple questions such as"
" “What text is in this range?” or “Is the cursor on bolded text?” Trying "
"to build rich editing experiences on top of such primitives is very "
"difficult and frustrating."
msgstr "没有DOM API,其中的字符是测量单位. 有了这个限制,最丰富的文本编辑器不能回答简单的问题,比如“在此范围内什么短信？”或“上黑体字光标？”试图在这样的原语之上构建丰富的编辑经验是非常困难和令人沮丧. "

"Quill was designed for editing and characters in mind, and built its APIs"
" on top of these natural text centric units. To find out if something is "
"bold, Quill does not require traversing the DOM looking for ``<b>`` or "
"``<strong>`` nodes or a font-weight style attributes—just call "
"```getFormat(5, 1)`` </docs/api/#getformat>`__. All of its core `API "
"</docs/api/>`__ calls allow arbitrary indexes and lengths for access or "
"modification. Its `event API </docs/api/#events>`__ also reports changes "
"in an intuitive JSON format. No need to parse HTML or diff DOM trees."
msgstr "奎尔是专为编辑和人物记,并建立在这些天然的文字为中心的单位的顶部它的API. 要了解,如果事情是大胆的,奎尔不需要遍历DOM寻找 ``<B>`` 或 ``<STRONG>`` 节点或字体重样式属性,只需要调用的 ```getFormat(5, 1)`` </docs/api/#getformat>`__. 所有的核心 `event API </docs/api/#events>`__  呼叫允许访问或修改任意索引和长度. 其`事件API </docs/api/#events>`__ 还报告以直观的JSON格式的变化. 无需解析HTML或差异DOM树. "

"It was not far in the past that evaluating rich text editors was as "
"simple as comparing a checklist of desired formats. The mark of a good "
"rich text editor was simply how many formats it supported. This is still "
"an important measure, but the lower bound is approaching infinity."
msgstr "这是不远的过去,在评价丰富的文本编辑器是作为比较的期望格式清单一样简单. 一个很好的富文本编辑器的标志是它只是多少格式支持. 这仍然是一个重要措施,但下界接近无穷大. "

"Text is no longer written to be printed. It is written to be rendered on "
"the web—a much richer canvas than paper. Content can be live, "
"interactive, or even collaborative. Only some rich text editors can even "
"support simple media like images and videos; almost none can embed a "
"tweet or interactive graph. Yet this is the direction the web is moving: "
"richer and more interactive. The tools supporting content creation need "
"to consider these use cases."
msgstr "文本不再写来打印. 这是写比纸网,更丰富的画布上呈现. 内容可以是实时,互动,甚至协作. 只有一些富文本编辑器甚至可以支持简单的媒体,如图像和视频;几乎没有可以嵌入鸣叫或交互式图形. 然而,这是互联网的移动方向：更丰富,更具互动性. 支持内容创作工具需要考虑这些用例. "

"models."

"Cross platform support is important to many Javascript libraries, but the"
" criteria for what this means often differs. For Quill, the bar is not "
"just that it runs or works, it has to run or work *the same way*. Not "
"only is functionality a cross platform consideration, but user and "
"developer experience is as well. If some content produces a particular "
"markup in Chrome on OSX, it will produce the same markup on IE. If "
"hitting enter preserves bold format state in Firefox on Windows, it will "
"be preserved on mobile Safari."
