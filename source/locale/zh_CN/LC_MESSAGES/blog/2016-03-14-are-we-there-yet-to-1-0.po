"When Quill laid out its `1.0 roadmap </blog/the-road-to-1-0/>`__, core to"
" its journey was the development of a new document model called "
"Parchment. Today a beta release of Parchment is being made available on "
"`Github <https://github.com/quilljs/parchment>`__ and `NPM "
"<https://www.npmjs.com/package/parchment>`__."

"What this means is its design and API is reasonably stable and the "
"adventurous can now take an early look. The latest Quill source is "
"already using Parchment to implement its formatting and content "
"capabilities, and its `integration "
"<https://github.com/quilljs/quill/tree/develop/formats>`__ would be a "
"helpful example of Parchment in action. Of course, this is in addition to"
" Parchment’s own `documentation "
"<https://github.com/quilljs/parchment/blob/master/README.md>`__."

"Parchment enables Quill to scalably support many formats and many are "
"being added in 1.0. The list includes headers, blockquotes, code, "
"superscript, subscript, text direction, nested lists, and video embeds. "
"Syntax highlighted code and formulas will also be available through "
"externally supported modules. In addition, formats that previously relied"
" on style attributes are reimplemented to optionally use classes instead."
" By default, fonts, sizes, and text alignment will use classes, while "
"foreground and background colors will still use style attributes, since "
"there are so many possible color values."
