"The skeleton of a new documentation site is also being built out at "
"`beta.quilljs.com <https://beta.quilljs.com>`__. Whereas the current site"
" focuses on being a referential resource, the new site will also be a "
"guide to provide insight on approaching different customization goals. "
"There is also an `interactive playground "
"<https://beta.quilljs.com/playground/>`__ to try out various "
"configurations and explore the API."

"The goal now is of course an official 1.0 release. To get there, Quill "
"will now enter a weekly cadence of beta releases, so you can expect rapid"
" interations on stability and bug fixes each week. Github is still the "
"center of all development so please do report `Issues "
"<https://github.com/quilljs/quill/issues>`__ as you encounter them in the"
" beta preview."
