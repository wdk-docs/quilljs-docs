msgid "Each version of Quill is built and ready to use from a variety of sources, including `NPM <https://www.npmjs.com/package/quill>`__ or its `CDN </docs/download/>`__. However there may be use cases where you would like to build Quill from source, as part of your application’s build pipeline. If this desire has not occurred to you, don’t sweat it! Using pre-built versions is the easiest way to use Quill."

The purpose of the entry files for both builds, `quill.js <https://github.com/quilljs/quill/blob/master/quill.js>`__ and `core.js <https://github.com/quilljs/quill/blob/master/core.js>`__, is to import and register necessary dependencies.
