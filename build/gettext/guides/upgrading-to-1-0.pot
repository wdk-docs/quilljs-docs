msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:4
msgid "Quill 1.0 introduces major changes aimed at greater ability to customize Quill. Interfaces stayed the same where possible and this guide helps bridge the gap otherwise."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:8
msgid "To realize the full benefits of 1.0, it is encouraged to take a fresh view of Quill 1.0 and revisit even basic topics on this documentation site. Often, you will find that even though you could do things the old way, there is a better new way."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:14
msgid "Configuration"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:16
msgid "``styles`` *removed* - Previous versions of Quill allowed custom CSS to be injected through ``<style>`` additions. This option has been removed due to `Content Security Policy <https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/csp/>`__. Instead you should use external CSS directly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:23
msgid "API"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:25
msgid "``getHTML`` *removed* - Previous versions of Quill required the usage of class names to identify lines ``ql-line`` and an ``id`` attribute to identify particular lines. This is no longer a requirement and a custom API call no longer adds any value on top of the DOMâ€™s existing innerHTML."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:31
msgid "``setHTML`` *removed* - Quill, like many editors with a data layer on top of the DOM, does not allow arbitrary changes to the underlying HTML. Previously Quill would detect an illegal state and correct it, but this makes the naming setHTML disingenuous and the reasoning behind the correction is unintuitive. Most use cases of ``setHTML`` can be suitably met or improved (since cursor preservation is much better) with the new ```pasteHTML`` </docs/api/#pastehtml>`__."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:39
msgid "``addModule`` *removed* - Modules are now initialized based off of the initial Quill `configuration </docs/configuration/>`__, instead of having a separate function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:43
msgid "``onModuleLoad`` *removed* - Module loading is handled by Themes and similar behavior should be achieved by extending the theme."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:46
msgid "``destroy`` *removed* - No longer necessary as Quill no longer keeps references to editor instances, allowing Javascript garbage collectors to work as expected."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:50
msgid "``prepareFormat`` *renamed* - A new API ```format`` </docs/api/#format>`__ now provides formatting functionality for all selection states, including those previously covered by ``prepareFormat``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:55
msgid "For consistency, all positions are now index and length based versus the start and end representation sometimes used by ```deleteText`` </docs/api/#deletetext>`__, ```formatText`` </docs/api/#formattext>`__, ```formatLine`` </docs/api/#formatline>`__, and the Range object used by selection APIs such as on ```getSelection`` </docs/api/#getselection>`__, ```setSelection`` </docs/api/#setselection>`__, and the ```selection-change`` </docs/api/#selection-change>`__ event."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:65
msgid "``registerModule`` *renamed* - A new API ```register`` </docs/api/#register>`__ is now used to registers all modules, themes and formats."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:69
msgid "``require`` *renamed* - Renamed to ``import`` for consistency with ES6."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:72
msgid "``addContainer`` *modified* - The `second parameter </docs/api/#addcontainer>`__ is changed to allow insertion before any container, not just the editor. Thus instead of an optional boolean, it now an optional HTMLElement."

msgid "Modules"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:80
msgid "Toolbars, when initialized with a custom HTML element, requires buttons to be actual HTMLButtonElements. Previously it allowed any element with an appropriate class name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:84
msgid "The `Snow </docs/themes/#snow/>`__ toolbar no longer adds or uses ``ql-format-separator`` and renamed ``ql-format-group`` to ``ql-formats``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:88
msgid "The authorship and multi-cursor modules have been temporarily removed. Similar functionality will be re-added at a later time, either separately or in a bundled collaboration module."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:92
msgid "UndoManager has been renamed to `History </docs/modules/history/>`__."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:94
msgid "PasteManager has been renamed to `Clipboard </docs/modules/clipboard/>`__, and will provide custom copy and paste behavior."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:98
msgid "LinkTooltip has been moved to be theme specific. With the addition of `Bubble </docs/themes/#bubble>`__ and videos and `formulas </docs/modules/formula/>`__, it no longer made sense to open a separate tooltip for links as its own general UI element. The old tooltip behavior is still present in Snow, but is now specific to that theme."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:105
msgid "ImageTooltip has been removed in favor of a simpler and more native flow. The image button now opens the OS file picker and the selected image file is inserted into the editor as a base64 image."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:110
msgid "Deltas"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:112
msgid "The default `Delta </guides/working-with-deltas/>`__ representation of some content has changed. In all cases the old format is still supported in methods using Deltas as in input, such as ``setContents`` and ``updateContents``. But outputted Deltas, such as the ones reported by ``text-change`` and ``getContents`` will be in the new form. Since `Parchment <https://github.com/quilljs/parchment>`__ now allows custom content and formats, it is possible to customize these Delta representations entirely."

msgid "Defaults"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/upgrading-to-1-0.rst:162

msgid "Browsers"
msgstr ""
