msgid "The new rich text type is now live and being used in Quill v0.18.0. It is a big step towards 1.0 and will be the way documents and changes are represented going forward. In most cases this update is non-disruptive and an upgrade can be a simple increment of the version number [1]_."

msgid "There are some optimizations performed by rich-text such as excluding no-ops (delete 0 characters) and merging two adjacent operations of the same type (insert ‘A’ followed by insert ‘B’ is merged to be a single insert ‘AB’ operation). But you should not have to worry about these cases since the old Delta format had similar optimizations."
