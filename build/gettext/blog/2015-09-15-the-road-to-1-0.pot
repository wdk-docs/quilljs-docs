msgid "A full introduction and guide to Parchment is still forthcoming, but in short it is a new document model for Quill. An editor’s document model is an important abstraction over the DOM that allows the editor and API users to reason about its contents through a much simpler yet more expressive interface than directly interacting with the browser. For Quill, this enables an elegant solution to the longstanding problem of format customization."

msgid "Prior to Parchment, Quill required near complete control over its editor container and descendant DOM nodes in order to provide its precise retrieval and manipulation API. Even simple modifications such as changing the default link open behavior required hacks and defining new content types, such as syntax highlighted code, was impossible."

msgid "Parchment hands control of entire subtrees back to the user, allowing the definition of new nodes or overwriting existing ones. The requirement is that certain methods such as ``getValue`` and ``getFormat`` be defined in order to happily exist within a Parchment document. Those familiar will find this very similar to ``render`` and Components in `React <https://facebook.github.io/react/>`__, a significant influencer of Parchment’s design."

msgid "The current priority is to integrate Parchment into Quill as its new document model. However, Parchment is and will remain organized as its own `repository <https://github.com/quilljs/parchment>`__, as it was designed as a general purpose tool. Hopefully one day it may serve as the document model for other editors as well."

msgid "Parchment opens the doors to scalably support many more formats, many of which will be included in the 1.0 release. The complete list is not ready for announcement but they will at least include semantic headers and nested lists. Equations and syntax highlighted code will also be added as separate repositories because of their likely dependency on external libraries."
