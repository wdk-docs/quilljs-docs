msgid "Customizability is core to Quill’s ethos and the new `v0.19 release <https://github.com/quilljs/quill/releases/tag/v0.19.0>`__ is a big step towards fulfilling that mission. In previous versions Quill utilized an iframe to contain the editor. This unfortunately prevented expected browser behaviors and made it difficult for developers to access and extend Quill [1]_. Its removal is the biggest change in v0.19 and some rippling effects are expected. They, and other changes for v0.19, are summarized here."

msgid "You can now pass ``false`` into the `style config </docs/configuration/#styles>`__ to prevent Quill from injecting any ``<style>`` tags. No change is necessary if the default behavior is preferred, but this added option makes it easier and more efficient for those that prefer to completely control styling with stylesheets. For this latter route, ``quill.base.css`` is now included in releases and the CDN."

msgid "It was always possible to access and manipulate Quill’s editor, but without an iframe the task is now easy. While this greatly simplifies custom enhancements it also makes it easier to inadvertently interfere with Quill’s necessary operations. But with modern developer tools and practices, the risks can be mitigated and ultimately the benefits of customization is worthwhile."
