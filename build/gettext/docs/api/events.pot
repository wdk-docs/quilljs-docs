For example, when a user clicks on the toolbar, technically the toolbar module calls a Quill API to effect the change. But source is still ``\"user\"`` since the origin of the change was the userâ€™s click."

msgid "APIs causing text to change may also be called with a ``\"silent\"`` source, in which case ``text-change`` will not be emitted. This is not recommended as it will likely break the undo stack and other functions that rely on a full record of text changes."

msgid "Changes to text may cause changes to the selection (ex. typing advances the cursor), however during the ``text-change`` handler, the selection is not yet updated, and native browser behavior may place it in an inconsistent state. Use ```selection-change`` <#selection-change>`__ or ```editor-change`` <#editor-change>`__ for reliable selection updates."

msgid "Emitted when a user or API causes the selection to change, with a range representing the selection boundaries. A null range indicates selection loss (usually caused by loss of focus from the editor). You can also use this event as a focus change event by just checking if the emitted range is null or not."

msgid "APIs causing the selection to change may also be called with a ``\"silent\"`` source, in which case ``selection-change`` will not be emitted.
